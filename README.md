Go package to work with [TREZOR devices](http://bitcointrezor.com/). This repository is an unofficial package written in Go (golang), for any official package, code or tool, please go to the official [TREZOR repository](https://github.com/trezor)

## What is TREZOR?

TREZOR is a single purpose device which allows you to make secure Bitcoin transactions. With TREZOR, transactions are completely safe even when initiated on a compromised or vulnerable computer.
